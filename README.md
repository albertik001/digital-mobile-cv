**Key Project: [TezSat](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tezsat.tezsat)**

In my role at [GeekStudio](https://www.geekstudio.kg/), I made substantial contributions to the TezSat project, implementing several key improvements:

- **Activity Streamlining**: I utilized a modular approach and MainFlowFragment to merge two separate activities into one, significantly simplifying the application's navigation.
- **Asynchronous Photo Upload**: Leveraged the power of Coroutines Await to implement asynchronous photo upload requests, enhancing the user experience with more responsive interactions.
- **Error Handling & Documentation**: Established a robust error handling system, and developed comprehensive documentation using Dokka Kdoc, increasing application reliability and maintainability.
- **Project Cleanup**: Executed a project cleanup that reduced the APK size by 20%, leading to quicker downloads and more efficient storage use.

These initiatives substantially improved the app's performance, user experience, and scalability, demonstrating my ability to drive impactful enhancements in complex projects.

**Project [Karyshkyr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geekstudio.karyshkyr)** is a mobile application that I developed from scratch, single-handedly, before its release on the Play Store. It features a collection of popular phrases and slang in the Kyrgyz language.

During the development of the Karyshkyr app, I utilized the following technologies and approaches:

1. **Individual Development**: I worked on the project solo, from inception to release on the Play Store. This allowed me to have complete control over the development process and ensure a high-quality app.

2. **Room DB Integration**: To store user-selected favorite words, I implemented Room DB, a powerful tool for working with an internal app database. This enabled users to save and manage their preferences effectively.

3. **Simplified Authentication**: Instead of complex login procedures, I decided not to require user login considering the small size and nature of the application.

4. **Dependency Injection with Hilt**: I incorporated Hilt, a dependency injection tool, to simplify dependency management and provide flexibility during app development and maintenance.

5. **Redesigned UI**: In one of the updates, I completely reimagined the app's design, rewriting it from scratch. This enhanced the visual experience for users and made the app more modern and appealing.

These approaches and technologies employed in developing the Karyshkyr app resulted in a unique and functional application, capable of meeting user needs and delivering a seamless user experience.

**Android Mentor** @ [Geeks](https://geeks.edu.kg/) _(December 2021 - June 2022)_ <br>
