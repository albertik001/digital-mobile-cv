Hello! I am a front-end developer with 1.7 years of experience specializing in web application development using **_React, Redux, MUI, TypeScript, Webpack, babel, Redux-toolkit and Next.js._**

During this time, I gained experience in designing UI components, writing code to manage application state, interacting with the server side of an application, and optimizing application performance. I have worked with **_Redux_** tools like **_Redux-thunk_** and **_Redux-saga_** as well as **_Redux-toolkit_** for faster and more efficient development.

I'm also familiar with responsive design principles and using the **_MUI_** library to simplify user interface development. In addition, I have experience with **_TypeScript_**, which allows me to write more secure and maintainable code.

I am familiar with web application build tools such as Webpack and Babel and have experience with **_Next.js_** to build server-rendered applications.

I am always striving for self-improvement and improvement of my skills, so I try to learn new technologies and tools. I work well in a team and I am ready to share my knowledge and experience with other developers so that we can create high-quality and efficient code together.
